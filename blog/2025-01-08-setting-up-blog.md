I don’t know why, but I liked hosting my service on my own instead of using an existing one. I like having this control for myself. I’ve hosted my own cloud storage, Office Suite, ChatGPT, ad blocker, and finance tracker, all accessible through a VPN. With the same thought, I decided to host the blog.

<!-- truncate -->
Let's not talk too much about that part; let’s discuss how I set up my own blog. It’s very simple. I’m using Docusaurus to build my content with Markdown (mostly) and MDX, generate the static assets, and deploy them to GitHub Pages. Tada, that’s all! That’s how I have hosted my own blog.

So, from now on, I’ll be posting all my content on the blog and sharing the links on social networks. This blog is tracker-free, meaning I won’t track any activities like user interactions or user details, although GitHub might. So, you won’t see any privacy or tracker banners on this webpage. There are no plans to integrate ads, so you can read peacefully without any distractions. There are no paid plans, meaning you don’t need to pay anything to read, now or in the future. Basically, this blog is kind of like my scribble pad, but with some quality content. I’m not planning to add like buttons or comments as of right now, so you will see only the content.

I’m also planning to post content in Spanish. I don’t know, maybe in the near future, I will. Since this is my first blog, I don’t know what to talk about, so I’m just posting my on-the-fly thoughts. I felt that writing a blog would allow me to express myself and my thoughts more boldly and better, so I started one. I don’t know how often I’ll post, but I’ll try to make it a habit. I can assure you that I won’t use AI to generate content; rather, I’ll use it for grammar correction and polishing my content in a simpler and more elegant way. The ideas and thoughts are from my own NN 🧠.

By the way, if you’ve reached this point, then you may like my content and my talk. So, yeah, thanks for reading my first blog. Wishing you a happy 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣5️⃣!!
